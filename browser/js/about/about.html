    		I'm a software engineer who is passionate about Education.
        </p><p>
        	After graduating Wesleyan University, I spent three years teaching middle school science in East Harlem.  While teaching, I taught myself to program in order to use it with my students to analyze data. I quickly discovered my passion for it, and decided to attend Fullstack Academy, a 13 week intensive software development bootcamp.
        </p><p>
            Following that, I decided to attend the Recurse Center, a self-directed, educational retreat for programmers in order to improve my skills, learn new technologies, and study more theoretical concepts.  While attending, I worked on hardware simmulation, built a game engine, learned React, Redux and web scraping, and collaborated on various other projects with other software engineers.
        </p><p>
        	I have extensive experience in the MEAN stack and PostgreSQL, as well as familiarity with MySQL, React, C++, and Python.  Moreover, I learn new technologies quickly.
