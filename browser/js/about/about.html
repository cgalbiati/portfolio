    		I'm a software engineer who is passionate about Education.

        	After graduating Wesleyan University, I spent three years teaching middle school science in East Harlem.  While teaching, I taught myself to program in order to use it with my students to analyze data. I quickly discovered my passion for it, and decided to attend Fullstack Academy, a 13 week intensive software development bootcamp.

        	I have extensive experience in the MEAN stack, as well as familiarity with MySQL, C++, and Python.  Moreover, I learn new technologies quickly.
