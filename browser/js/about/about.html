    		I'm a software engineer who is passionate about Education.
        </p><p>
        	After graduating Wesleyan University, I spent three years teaching middle school science in East Harlem.  I taught myself programming in order to use it with my students to analyze data. I quickly discovered my passion for it, and decided to attend <a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy</a>, a 13 week intensive software development bootcamp.
        </p><p>
            Following that, I decided to attend the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, a self-directed, educational retreat for programmers in order to improve my skills, learn new technologies, and study more theoretical concepts.  While attending, I worked on hardware simmulation and web scraping, built a game engine, learned React and Redux, and collaborated on various projects with other software engineers.
        </p><p>
        	I have extensive experience in the MEAN stack, as well as familiarity with MySQL, PostgreSQL, React, C++, and Python.  Most importantly, I learn new technologies quickly.
